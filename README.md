  This is a haskell practices about Parser Monad followed by [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours)
  
  The last two sections are not included.
  
  At least, I have known how Monad works. The notes and codes are messy, just leave it here as a copy.
  
  The type system is annoying. T_T
